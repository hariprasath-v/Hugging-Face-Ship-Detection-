# HuggingFace-Ship-Detection

### Competition hosted on <a href="https://hf.co/spaces/competitions/ship-detection">Huggingface</a>

### Problem
80% of the worldâ€™s cargo is transported by ocean. Congested ports can become a massive problem because they disrupt supply chains. Port congestion means that ships arrive at the port and cannot load or unload, as the terminal is already full. So, they can only queue up and wait for their turn to get a spot at the port.

The economic impact of port congestion can be significant, as it leads to delays in the delivery of goods, increased shipping costs, and a decline in trade and economic growth. Congestion can also lead to higher prices for consumers and decreased competitiveness for businesses. The impact of port congestion can be felt across the entire supply chain, affecting everything from manufacturing to retail.

Your goal in this competition is to use satellite imagery to detect ships in ports. The resulting algorithm will allow port managers to better allocate port resources for incoming and outgoing vessels, and make more informed decisions to manage and optimize the logistics.

Ultimately, more accurate detection of ships helps avoid port congestion and ensure functioning supply chains.

### Evaluation
#### Evaluation metric for this competition is mAP at IOU threshold of 0.5.
